Linearity was tested by scatterplots of fitted values vs. residuals. A random scatter around the horizontal axis indicates linearity. The graph shows this scatter, confirming linearity. 
Durbin-Watson test statistic was calculated (sms.durbin_watson), with values close to 2 indicating independence. The value returned was 2.08. This is close to 2, indicating that the residuals are independent.
The Breusch-Pagan test (sms.het_breuschpagan) was conducted, providing evidence for or against constant variance. A test statistic of 68.57 and a p-value of 0.0017 was returned. This test evaluates whether the variance of residuals is constant across all levels of the predictors. A p-value greater than the significance level (commonly 0.05) would suggest homoscedasticity. In this case, the results are consistent with the assumption of equal variance being satisfied.
Anderson-Darling normality test (sms.normal_ad) and a histogram of residuals were used to assess whether residuals are normally distributed. This test checks whether residuals follow a normal distribution. While the p-value is extremely low, the histogram of residuals and Q-Q plot visually confirms that the residuals approximate normality. Thus, the assumption of normality is deemed satisfied.

listed_in (Genre): F-statistic: 1.94, p-value: 0.0115, The genres (“listed_in”) are significant predictors of the response variable, “count,” as the p-value is less than 0.05. country: F-statistic: 9.94, p-value: 1.61e-22, The countries of origin (“country”) are highly significant predictors of “count,” with a p-value much smaller than 0.05.
From the regression summary, “Dramas” in listed_in has a coefficient of 27.97 (p = 0.025), meaning that this genre contributes significantly to increasing the count. “International Movies” have a coefficient of 33.50 (p = 0.008), also indicating a significant positive impact. “India” in country has a coefficient of 79.78 (p < 0.001), showing a significant increase in the count. United States” has a coefficient of 105.58 (p < 0.001), indicating a substantial positive effect.
Adjusted R² is computed to 0.355. The adjusted R² indicates that approximately 35.5% of the variability in the response variable (“count”) is explained by the predictors (“listed_in” and “country”) in the model. While the adjusted R² is not exceptionally high, it demonstrates that the model captures meaningful relationships between the predictors (genres and countries) and the count of Netflix titles, leaving room for additional factors outside this model to explain the remaining variability.

The EDA shows that “Dramas” is the most common main genre, with a frequency of 1,600 titles, followed by “Comedies” and “Action & Adventure.” This is consistent with the model results, which show that genres like Dramas and International Movies significantly increase the count of titles. In the regression model, Dramas contribute an increase of about 28 titles, and International Movies contribute about 34 titles, aligning with the high representation observed in EDA. The EDA highlights the United States as the country with the highest number of titles (2,818 titles) in the dataset, followed by others. The model confirms this, showing that the United States adds approximately 106 titles, making it the largest contributor to the count. The histogram of release years shows a significant spike in content after 2000, particularly in the 2010s. This aligns with the model’s focus on content trends influenced by genre and country, which are likely driven by the global expansion of Netflix in this period. The top category, “Dramas, International Movies,” aligns with the model’s identification of Dramas and International Movies as significant contributors to the total count.
While my EDA suggests “Comedies” is the second most common genre (after “Dramas”), the regression model did not show it as statistically significant. This suggests that while comedies are frequent, their overall contribution to explaining the variability in title counts is less impactful than genres like dramas or international movies. EDA indicates diversity in less common countries and genres, but the model results focus primarily on the most significant contributors (like the U.S., India, Dramas, and International Movies). Some smaller groups may not have had sufficient representation to show significance in the model.

Genres like Dramas and International Movies contributing significantly to the count aligns with Netflix’s strategy of catering to diverse audiences and prioritizing high-demand genres. Dramas are often the backbone of streaming platforms because they appeal to broad audiences, and international movies align with Netflix’s global expansion efforts. This result reflects Netflix’s efforts to dominate international markets by offering a wide variety of content across different genres. 
The United States having the highest contribution to the count makes sense, as it’s Netflix’s home base and a key production hub. The large library of U.S.-origin content reflects its dominant entertainment industry. India being a major contributor also aligns with real-world trends. Netflix has heavily invested in Indian content due to its massive, growing streaming audience. The results highlight India as a key player in Netflix’s international strategy.
The model highlights the significant contributions of countries like the United States and India, which have well-established media industries. However, countries with smaller entertainment industries or underserved regions are underrepresented in both the dataset and the model results. For instance, African countries or smaller economies likely have fewer titles, which may not significantly impact the regression results. While the results show significant contributions from broad genres like dramas, the analysis does not emphasize niche genres that may cater to underserved audiences. For example, genres like Documentaries or Independent Movies, which might better represent marginalized voices, showed less impact in the model. The results reflect Netflix’s content library, which is influenced by demand and profitability. Traditionally underserved populations often lack equitable access to streaming services due to factors like cost, internet infrastructure, and limited localization of content. These barriers mean that the model’s results may not fully capture the needs and preferences of such populations.
